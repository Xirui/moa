'$1m payoff for former Shell boss\n\nShell is to pay $1m (拢522,000) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in April 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves.\n\nJudy Boynton finally left the firm on 31 December, having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive Jeroen van der Veer. In January 2004, Shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20\% smaller than previously thought. Shell said the pay-off was in line with Ms Boynton\'s contract. She was leaving \"by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities\", the firm said in a statement. The severance package means she keeps long-term share options, but fails to collect on a 2003 incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it.\n\nThe revelation that Shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman, Sir Phil Watts, and production chief Walter van der Vijver.\n\nAn investigation commissioned by Shell found that Ms Boynton had to share responsibility for the company\'s behaviour. Despite receiving an email from Mr Van de Vijver which said the firm had \"fooled\" the market about its reserves, the investigation said, she did nothing to inquire further. In all, Shell restated its reserves four times during 2003. In September, it paid 拢82.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves.\n'
'&#163;1.8m indecency fine for Viacom\n\nMedia giant Viacom has paid out $3.5m (拢1.8m) to end investigations into indecency in its US radio and TV shows.\n\nThe settlement to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ends a long-running saga dating back to 2001. The FCC was looking into 50 shows, including those by \"shock jock\" Howard Stern and two New York DJs. Stern recently announced he was leaving Viacom while the two DJs were sacked after their show featured a couple purporting to have sex in a church. After the church incident two years ago Viacom agreed to install audio delay equipment at its radio stations that broadcast live programming.\n\nIt also agreed to train its broadcasters and employees about indecency laws. The agreement cancels investigations into about 50 radio and television shows, said Richard Diamond, FCC deputy secretary of communications. The shows were broadcast by Viacom-owned stations across the United States. Viacom has five days to pay the $3.5m fine, according to the agreement. The payment is not related to the FCC\'s $550,000 (拢293,000) fine levied against Viacom after the exposure of singer Janet Jackson\'s breast during the CBS Super Bowl halftime show in January. Viacom is contesting that fine. It is not the first time that Viacom has paid out over indecency charges. Infinity Broadcasting, which is owned by Viacom, paid cumulative fines totalling $1.7m (拢907,000) in 1995 to settle FCC violations by Stern.\n'
'2004: An Irish Athletics Year\n\n2004 won\'t be remembered as one of Irish athletics\' great years.\n\nThe year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably, seems to herald an upcoming Olympiad. But come late August, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in Athens told us of the true strength of Irish athletics - or to be more accurate, the lack of it. Sonia O\'Sullivan\'s Olympic farewell apart, there was little to stir the emotions of Irish athletics watchers. But after the disastrous build-up to the games, we shouldn\'t have been surprised. At the start of the year, an O\'Sullivan had been earmarked as Ireland\'s best medal prospect but as it turned out, walker Gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. Less than a week before the Olympics, the sport was rocked by news that 10,000m hope Cathal Lombard had tested for the banned substance EPO. Lombard\'s shattering of Mark Carroll\'s national 10,000m record in April had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers, were surprised when he was rumbled after an Irish Sports Council sting operation. The Corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from the sport.\n\nBack at pre-Olympic ranch in Greece, it must have seemed that things couldn\'t have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker Jamie Costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near Athens. Once the track and field action began in Athens, a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although Alistair Cragg\'s performance in being the only athlete from a European nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future. Our beloved Sonia scraped into the women\'s 5K final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days, the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake-up. As it happened, she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner Meseret Defar. It later transpired that Sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically, the Cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness. Amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the Flora Lite 5K road race in London and while her major championship days may be over, it\'s unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. At least Sonia managed to make it to Athens. At the start of the year, several Northern Ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the Games but come August, an out-of-form and injured Paul Brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. The Ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem, and a bad lane draw, meant a time of 21.00 and an early exit.\n\nJames McIlroy, Gareth Turnbull, Zoe Brown and Paul McKee all had to be content with watching the Athens action on their television screens. 800m hope McIlroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the British trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane. The injury-plagued Turnbull gamely travelled round Europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve, after missing several months training during the previous winter. A lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked McKee\'s Athens ambitions and both he and Turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. Pole vaulter Brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the British selectors after she had achieved the Athens B standard but the call never came. As the summer ended, stalwarts Catherina McKiernan and Dermot Donnelly hung up their competitive spikes. McKiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years. Donnelly and his Annadale Striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman Andy Campbell was found dead at his home on 18 December. A large turnout of athletics-loving folk turned out in west Belfast to offer their respects to the Campbell family and Andy\'s many friends. As only death can, it put the year\'s athletics happenings in a sharp perspective.\n'
'2D Metal Slug offers retro fun\n\nLike some drill sergeant from the past, Metal Slug 3 is a wake-up call to today\'s gamers molly-coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings.\n\nWith its hand-animated sprites and 2D side-scrolling, this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago. But a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year. And yes, that includes Halo 2. Simply choose your grunt and wade through five 2D side-scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter. It is also the toughest game you are likely to play, as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on.\n\nPlayers must battle soldiers, snowmen, zombies, giant crabs and aliens, not to mention the huge, screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels.\n\nThe shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius. Fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers, instead, to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware. Tanks, jets and submarines can be commandeered, as well as cannon-toting camels, elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of Iraq. Doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls, and while this is a tough nut to crack, it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go. And at a mere 拢20, Metal Slug 3 is as cheap as sliced, fried spuds, as the man says. Of course, most of you will ignore this, lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters. But at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation, Metal Slug 3 is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the Xbox was not even a twinkle in Bill Gates\' eye.\n'

'\'Best person\' for top legal job\n\nThe \"best person for the job\" should be appointed lord chancellor, and not necessarily a lawyer or MP, the courts minister has told MPs.\n\nUnder reforms, the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions. \"The lord chancellor...no more needs to be a lawyer than the Secretary of Health needs to be a doctor,\" said courts minister Christopher Leslie. The Constitutional Reform Bill was entering its second reading on Monday. Mr Leslie said: \"The prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the House of Lords or the House of Commons.\" Under the reforms, the Law Lords will also be replaced as the UK\'s highest legal authority by a Supreme Court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers.\n\nIn December the Lords rejected a plea by current Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer. The peers voted by 229 to 206 to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers. The debate was carried over from the last Parliamentary session, but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the Bill passed. Mr Leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs or Lord Chancellor. He said: \"What matters most is...whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties. \"It is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges.\"\n\nShadow attorney general Dominic Grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an \"exceptional institution,\" providing a \"champion of the independence of the judiciary\". The government had initially proposed to take this institution and \"smash it to pieces,\" Mr Grieve said. Convention should be \"nurtured and celebrated,\" but the government distrusted and disliked it instead. He warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the House of Lords, the government would have \"great difficulty\" in getting the Bill through Parliament. Former Cabinet minister Douglas Hogg, whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor, said the Bill was \"largely unnecessary, bureaucratic and expensive\". But the Tory MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham admitted the lord chancellor\'s role and office \"cannot be frozen in aspic\".\n'
'\'Blog\' picked as word of the year\n\nThe term \"blog\" has been chosen as the top word of 2004 by a US dictionary publisher.\n\nMerriam-Webster said \"blog\" headed the list of most looked-up terms on its site during the last twelve months. During 2004 blogs, or web logs, have become hugely popular and some have started to influence mainstream media. Other words on the Merriam-Webster list were associated with major news events such as the US presidential election or natural disasters that hit the US.\n\nMerriam-Webster defines a blog as: \"a Web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections, comments and often hyperlinks\". Its list of most looked-up words is drawn up every year and it discounts terms such as swear words, that everyone likes to look up, or those that always cause problems, such as \"affect\" and \"effect\".\n\nMerriam-Webster said \"blog\" was the word that people have asked to be defined or explained most often over the last 12 months. The word will now appear in the 2005 version of Merriam-Webster\'s printed dictionary. However, the word is already included in some printed versions of the Oxford English Dictionary. A spokesman for the Oxford University Press said that the word was now being put into other dictionaries for children and learners, reflecting its mainstream use. \"I think it was the word of last year rather than this year,\" he said. \"Now we\'re getting words that derive from it such as \'blogosphere\' and so on,\" he said. \"But,\" he added, \"it\'s a pretty recent thing and in the way that this happens these days it\'s got established very quickly.\"\n\nBlogs come in many different forms. Many act as news sites for particular groups or subjects, some are written from a particular political slant and others are simply lists of interesting sites. Other terms in the top 10 were related to natural disasters that have struck the US, such as \"hurricane\" or were to do with the US election. Words such as \"incumbent\", \"electoral\" and \"partisan\" reflected the scale of interest in the vote. Blogs also proved very useful to both sides in the US election battle because many pundits who maintain their own journals were able to air opinions that would never appear in more mainstream media. Speculation that President Bush was getting help during debates via a listening device was first aired on web logs. Online journals also raised doubts about documents used by US television news organisation CBS in a story about President Bush\'s war record. The immediacy of many blogs also helped some wield influence over topics that made it in to national press.\n\nThis is despite the fact that the number of people reading even the most influential blogs is tiny. Statistics by web influence ranking firm HitWise reveal that the most popular political blog racks up only 0.0051\% of all net visits per day. One of the reasons that blogs and regularly updated online journals have become popular is because the software used to put them together make it very easy for people to air their views online. According to blog analysis firm Technorati the number of blogs in existence, the blogosphere, has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. Technorati now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million. Some speculate that less than a quarter of this number are regularly maintained. According to US research firm Pew Internet & American Life a blog is created every 5.8 seconds. Another trend this year has been the increasing numbers of weblogs that detail the daily lives of many ordinary workers in jobs that few people know much about. In many repressive regimes and developing nations, blogs have been embraced by millions of people keen to give their plight a voice.\n'
'\'Brainwave\' cap controls computer\n\nA team of US researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer.\n\nFour people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. Previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. The New York team reported their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \"The results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions,\" said Jonathan Wolpaw and Dennis McFarlane. The research team, from New York State Department of Health and State University of New York in Albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.\n\nThe four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which, meant no surgery or implantation was needed.\n\nBrain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. Complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. Such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. \"The impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm, a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis,\" said the researchers. The four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. Although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. It is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. Some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. Earlier this year, a team at the MIT Media Labs Europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.\n'

'\'Christmas song formula\' unveiled\n\nA formula for the ultimate Christmas single has been revealed by chart bible British Hit Singles and Albums.\n\nThe recipe includes a reference to Father Christmas, sleigh bells, a children\'s choir and a charity element. The song should also include Christmas in the title, wishes for peace on earth and lots of airplay at office parties. \"There are common musical elements linking nearly all the big Christmas number ones of recent times,\" said editor David Roberts. The book\'s analysts commissioned chart prank group Moped to create the first Christmas single using the whole formula - the song is called Gonna Have a No 1 This Christmas by Moped Vs Santa.\n\n\"Everybody says that Christmas number ones are formulaic, but Gonna Have a Number One this Christmas is the first song to crack the formula and combine all these elements into one ultimate Christmas track\" said Mr Roberts. \"Surprisingly, there\'s no Santa listed among the 8,000, top 75 chart performers in the book, so this is our chance to help Santa to his rightful place in British recording history.\" Big festive hits over the years include Band Aid\'s Do They Know It\'s Christmas?, Slade\'s Merry Christmas Everybody, Wham\'s Last Christmas and Sir Cliff Richards\' Mistletoe and Wine. Band Aid 20\'s remake of Do They Know It\'s Christmas is set to be confirmed as number one in the charts on Sunday.\n'
'\'Comeback\' show for Friends star\n\nFriends actress Lisa Kudrow is to play the lead role in a new series about a one-time sitcom star, according to the Hollywood reporter.\n\nThirteen episodes of Comeback have been commissioned by cable channel HBO, home of hits such as Sex And The City. Kudrow, who played Phoebe in Friends, co-wrote the pilot episode and will also act as executive producer. HBO has been looking for its next big comedy hit since Sex And The City drew to a close in the US in February. Comeback is the first 30-minute comedy series that the channel has picked up since the Sex And The City drew to the end of its six-year-run. Friends ended its 10-year run on the NBC network in May, and attentions have turned to which projects its six individual stars would pursue.\n\nMatt LeBlanc is starring in a Friends spin-off sitcom, charting Joey\'s fortunes in Los Angeles as he pursues his acting career. Jennifer Aniston, who was Rachel in the long-running show, has enjoyed a series of successful film appearances, with further projects in the pipeline. Courteney Cox Arquette (Monica) has been working on a drama project along with husband David Arquette for HBO, called The Rise And Fall Of Taylor Kennedy. Matthew Perry, who played Chandler, has appeared on the West End stage, and has a film, The Beginning Of Wisdom, currently in production. And David Schwimmer (Ross) directed during his time on Friends, and has also worked on Joey.\n'
'\'Debate needed\' on donations cap\n\nA cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.\n\nFears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. In a new report, the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a 拢10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.\n\nThere were almost 拢68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly 拢12m of them from individual gifts worth more than 拢1m. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. \"While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,\" says its report. If there was to be a cap, it should be 拢10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned 拢56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.\n\nEven without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 拢200. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to 拢3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.\n\nThe report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from 拢20m to 拢15m. The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: \"There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. \"Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. \"The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.\" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.\n'

'\'Errors\' doomed first Dome sale\n\nThe initial attempt to sell the Millennium Dome failed due to a catalogue of errors, a report by the government\'s finance watchdog says.\n\nThe report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the Millennium exhibition ended. The National Audit Office said the Dome cost taxpayers 拢28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. Finally, a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. More than 拢550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in Greenwich, London.\n\nThe NAO report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the Dome. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said a good deal had been secured. \"Delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the Millennium Village and elsewhere on the peninsula,\" he said. But Edward Leigh, who is chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the Dome deal. He said: \"This report also shows that the first attempt to sell the Dome proved a complete fiasco. Every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. The process was confused and muddled.\" He added: \"Four years after the Millennium Exhibition closed, the Government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that, incredible as it may seem, should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. However, it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt.\" NAO head Sir John Bourn said: \"In difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition, English Partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.\"\n'
'\'EU referendum could cost 拢80m\'\n\nIt could cost 拢80m to run a UK referendum on the European constitution, ministers have revealed.\n\nIn a written parliamentary answer, Constitutional Affairs Minister Chris Leslie said the poll was likely to cost the same as a general election. Mr Leslie said the cost could not be compared with the only previous British referendum, held 30 years ago. Ministers say the constitution would make the European Union work better but critics fear creating a \"super state\". Labour MP John Cryer, whose question revealed the price estimate, said the cost surprised him but was not a central factor as it was important people had their say. But he said it would have been better to have rejected the constitution so avoiding the need for a referendum. The 2001 election cost 拢80m. No date for the vote has been set but Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has suggested it is unlikely to be held until early 2006 - after the predicted date for the next election. Most voters said the UK should stay in the Common Market in the 1975 referendum.\n'
'\'Evil twin\' fear for wireless net\n\nPeople using wireless high-speed net (wi-fi) are being warned about fake hotspots, or access points.\n\nThe latest threat, nicknamed evil twins, pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations, say Cranfield University experts. Once logged onto an Evil Twin, sensitive data can be intercepted. Wi-fi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability. London leads the global wi-fi hotspots league, with more than 1,000. The number of hotspots is expected to reach 200,000 by 2008, according to analysts. \"Users need to be wary of using their wi-fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature,\" said Professor Brian Collins, head of information systems at Cranfield University.\n\n\"Users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wi-fi device has its security measures activated,\" he added. BT Openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK, told the BBC News website that it made every effort to make its wi-fi secure. \"Naturally, people may have security concerns,\" said Chris Clark, chief executive for BT\'s wireless broadband.\n\n\"But wi-fi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet, like broadband or dial-up.\" He said BT Openzone, as well as others, have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot. \"This means that users\' personal information and data, logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure,\" said Mr Clark.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible, said Dr Nobles. Cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam, jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client. Anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin. \"Cybercriminals don\'t have to be that clever to carry out such an attack,\" said Dr Phil Nobles, a wireless net and cybercrime expert at Cranfield. \"Because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency.\"\n\nAlthough wi-fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high-speed net on the move, there have been fears over how secure it is. Some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security. A wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a company\'s computer system. Public wi-fi hotspots offered by companies like BT Openzone and The Cloud, are accessible after users sign up and pay for use. But many home and company wi-fi networks are left unprotected and can be \"sniffed out\" and hi-jacked by anyone with the correct equipment. \"BT advises that customers should change all default settings, make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly,\" said Mr Clark. \"We also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted.\" Dr Nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the Science Museum\'s Dana Centre in London on Thursday.\n'
'\'Few ready\' for information act\n\nThousands of public bodies are ill-prepared for the Freedom of Information Act, due to come into force next month, because of government failures, say MPs.\n\nFrom next month anyone will have the power to demand information from a range of public bodies - from Whitehall departments to doctors\' surgeries. But an all-party committee said it was \"not confident\" many would be ready. It blamed the Department for Constitutional Affairs for a \"lack of consistent leadership\".\n\nThe Act comes into effect in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, on 1 January while similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions.\n\nBut the government department responsible for implementing the change suffered from an \"unusually high turnover\" of staff within the department, which had \"seriously interfered\" with its work, said the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee. It said, despite four years of preparations, some local authorities and parts of the health sector were still not ready. The DCA had \"failed\" to provide early guidance on technical matters and shown a \"lack of consistent leadership\", the MPs found. Committee chairman Alan Beith said: \"The DCA has had four years to prepare for freedom of information, but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared. \"Our report shows that in the past support and guidance from the DCA, which has overall responsibility for guiding the public sector through the process of implementation for the freedom of information regime, has been lacking.\" A spokesman for the DCA said: \"The DCA has provided - and will continue to provide - strong, clear leadership. \"It has delivered a simple, liberal fees regime, guidance on the Act which has been widely praised, and expert networks of staff working on freedom of information implementation.\"\n'
'\'Fido\' to be taken off vote lists\n\nThe risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote, the UK elections watchdog has said.\n\nThose are some of the mistakes found under the current system, where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants. The Electoral Commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud. Voters need to register by 11 March if the next poll is on 5 May as expected. But any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in Britain before that general election.\n\nThe proposed scheme would mean voters using individual \"identifiers\" when they vote - such as their own voting number, date of birth and signature. The Electoral Commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws. Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system. There have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll, the MPs heard. And some people have registered all their family, regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check. Non-British citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases.\n\nMr Younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register, the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes. He argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at \"hard to reach\" voters, for example. Some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out. Mr Younger said using the Royal Mail\'s postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters.\n\nHe argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting. There have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form. He said it might also help register students in halls of residences, where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody. The MPs on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs select committees pressed Mr Younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover. He said the Northern Ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted. Currently, British voters have to re-register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running. Mr Younger suggested the re-registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up-to-date.\n'
'\'Friends fear\' with lost mobiles\n\nPeople are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends.\n\nMore than 50\% of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years. More than half (54\%) of those asked in a poll for mobile firm Intervoice said that they do not have another address book. A fifth rely entirely on mobiles. About 80\% of UK adults own at least one mobile, according to official figures. It is estimated that 53\% of over 65s own a mobile, according to Intervoice, but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34.\n\nMost 15 to 24-year-olds (94\%), and 25 to 34-year-olds (92\%), own at least one. Nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts\' information again if the phone was lost, stolen or replaced.\n\nThe survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book. Many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of their contact details, and with people changing their phones once a year on average, it becomes a problem. They also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart, relying on the mobile phone book instead. \"We\'re a nation of lazy so-and-sos,\" David Noone from Intervoice said. \"We put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can\'t be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book. \"The mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships; take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart.\" One in three women, the survey said, thought if they lost their phones, it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether. Most (62\%) said they had no idea what their partner\'s number was. Mr Noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself, instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves.\n\nGenerally, information from Sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards, or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software. Sim back-up devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds.\n\nBut some operators offer customers free web-based back-up services too. Orange told the BBC News website that those with Orange Smartphones could use the My Phone syncing service which means back-ups of address books and other data are created online. For non-smartphone users, a Memory Mate card could be used to back up data on the phone. O2 also offers a free, web-based syncing service which works over GPRS and GSM. Neither Vodafone or T-Mobile currently offer a free network service for back-ups, but encourage people to use Sim back-up devices. It is thought that about 10,000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50\% of total street crime involves a mobile. Mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year. Globally, more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004, 26\% more than the previous year, according to analysts. It is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005.\n'
'\'Golden economic period\' to end\n\nTen years of \"golden\" economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly, City consultancy Deloitte has warned.\n\nThe UK economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market, triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment. Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2\% this year, below Chancellor Gordon Brown\'s forecast of 3\% to 3.5\%. It also believes that interest rates will fall to 4\% by the end of the year.\n\nIn its quarterly economic review, Deloitte said the UK economy had enjoyed a \"golden period\" during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.\n\nBut it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major \"imbalances\" in the economy. Deloitte\'s chief economic advisor Roger Bootle said: \"The biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown. \"Whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.\"\n\nEconomic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, Deloitte believes. Gordon Brown will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term, the firm claims. This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25\%. However, Deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the Bank of England to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering. It expects a series of \"aggressive\" interest rate cuts over the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75\% mark to 3.5\% by the end of 2006. \"Although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong, it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the UK economy,\" Mr Bootle.\n'
'\'Hitler\' row over Welsh arts cash\n\nAn artist critical of Welsh arts funding being brought under assembly government control has denied comparing the idea with dictatorships in Russia and Germany.\n\nShani Rhys James is worried that the Arts Council of Wales may be taken over by the Welsh Assembly Government. Culture Minister Alun Pugh said it would be \"crass and ignorant\" to liken a quango review to Hitler\'s Germany. But Ms James emphasised she had actually said artists needed freedom. The future of the Arts Council of Wales has been in question since it was announced that most Welsh quangos would eventually be abolished.\n\nIt was announced last July that three Welsh quangos, education and training body Elwa, the Wales Tourist Board and the Welsh Development Agency, would be brought under assembly government control. The Arts Council of Wales may be among the next to come under the assembly government\'s umbrella. But Ms James, who won the 拢30,000 Jerwood painting prize in 2003, said arts funding should be separate from government. Ms James told BBC Radio Wales: \"It\'s quite dangerous when you involve politicians because it\'s not like the health service and it\'s not like the railways. \"Free expression is absolutely vital in a democratic society. You need distance, you do not need government interference because it could be taken the wrong way.\"\n\nBut she said reports that she had likened the assembly government to totalitarian regimes were inaccurate.\n\nShe told Good Morning Wales: \"Just to put the record straight, that business in the paper where it said I likened the government to Bolshevik Russia or Hitler\'s Germany, the actual quote I gave was: \'It is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control\'. \"As we know from past European history, i.e. Russia and Germany in the early 20th Century, artists will go underground or leave the country or rather than compromise their expression\'. \"Artists need a free voice to express themselves - they reflect a truth through their own art forms.\'\" She said the assembly government was not best placed to run the arts in Wales.\n\nShe added: \"It would be a momentous change and devastating to the arts. It would set the arts scene back 60 years, because I really don\'t think the government has the expertise. \"If you have the National Assembly taking control, I fear you are going to be going back to the dragons and leeks and the choirs.\n\n\"Wales has moved on. It is international now. It is not set back in How Green Was My Valley?\" Responding to Ms James\' criticisms, Mr Pugh said: \"The structure of unelected quangos is under review and we have made it clear that further announcements are due shortly. \"Comparing the Welsh Assembly Government to Hitler\'s Germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic accountability.\" Ms James, whose father was Welsh, was born in Melbourne where her parents worked in the theatre. She moved to Powys nearly 20 years ago where she works from her studio near Llangadfan. She has won a number of arts prizes including the Wales Open in 1989 and the Mostyn Open in 1991.\n'
'\'Landmark movies\' of 2004 hailed\n\nUS film professionals have declared Fahrenheit 9/11 and The Passion of the Christ as two of the most significant cultural milestones of 2004.\n\nThe American Film Institute (AFI) hailed Mel Gibson\'s biblical epic and Michael Moore\'s political documentary as inspiring national debate. It claimed both film-makers \"tossed Hollywood convention out the window\". The Institute also cited the death of actor Marlon Brando and the changing landscape of TV news in the US. In referring to Marlon Brando\'s death on 1 July at the age of 80, the 13-strong AFI jury concluded \"the art of screen acting has two chapters - \'Before Brando\' and \'After Brando\'.\n\nIt credited the screen legend\'s \"raw hypnotic energy\" and his ability to create characters like Stanley Kowalski and Terry Malloy \"that will live forever in the annals of film history\". The list also acknowledges key influences and trends in the world of film and broadcasting. Among current trends, it highlighted the final broadcasts of veteran newscasters Tom Brokaw, Barbara Walters and the impending retirement of CBS news anchor Dan Rather. It its place, the AFI fears, is a news landscape where \"newscasters are more personalities than journalists\" and balance and integrity are increasingly ignored.\n\nThe AFI also questioned \"the long-term viability of evening news broadcasts\", in the light of 24-hour news channels and the internet. The list also draws attention to the growing influence of US broadcasting regulator, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\n\nThe institute concluded the threat of regulation, which went into freefall following Janet Jackson\'s \'wardrobe malfunction\' during a live Super Bowl performance in February, \"had a profound effect on television\". \"Unsure of how the FCC will rule on an issue, the creative community has begun to self-censor their shows, a disturbing trend in a country founded on free expression,\" the AFI jury declared. To illustrate their point, the AFI cited ABC affiliates refusal to air Steven Spielberg\'s film Saving Private Ryan in an unedited form over fears of possible fines.\n'
'\'Last chance\' warning for voters\n\nPeople in England, Scotland and Wales must have registered by 1700 GMT to be able to vote in the general election if it is held, as expected, on 5 May.\n\nThose who filled in forms last autumn should already be on the register - but those who have moved house or were on holiday may have been left off. There will also be elections for local councils and mayors in parts of England on 5 May. The deadline for voters to register in Northern Ireland expired on Thursday.\n\nCompleted registration forms can be handed into local authorities throughout the day on Friday, and some will accept them by fax. As well as for English county councils, polls for unitary authorities at Bristol, Isle of Wight and Stockton-on-Tees and mayors at Doncaster, Hartlepool, North Tyneside and Stoke-on-Trent are also scheduled for 5 May. Last week Preston City Council reported that more than 14,000 of its voters were not registered. Its electoral roll fell by 17.5\% in a year - the biggest dip in the UK. An Electoral Commission spokeswoman said: \"Political decisions are made on your behalf every day but only by using your right to vote at an election can you really have a say on the issues you care about. \"If you want your voice to be heard on 5 May you will need to have registered by Friday 11 March.\" Council tax payers are not eligible to vote without registration, officials have stressed.\n'
'\'More to do\' on adult literacy\n\nThe government will only hit its target for improving adult maths and literacy skills if courses are made more attractive, a report says.\n\nThe National Audit Office praised ministers for reaching the benchmark of 750,000 adults in England gaining basic qualifications by this year. But a target of 1.5 million more by 2010 needed \"creative\" ideas. Some 26 million adults lack maths or English skill levels expected of school-leavers.\n\nAccording to the report, \"more than half\" the qualifications achieved were by learners aged 16 to 18. These are defined as \"adults\" by the government for the purpose of compiling these figures. Normally adults are defined as being aged over 19. The number of these people gaining qualifications was \"rising slowly\". Auditor General Sir John Bourn said: \"Higher levels of literacy and numeracy will benefit England both socially and economically. \"More people will have the opportunity to live richer lives.\" In 2001, the government launched the Get On scheme - aimed at reducing illiteracy and innumeracy. Sir John said \"substantial progress\" had been made since, adding that this was \"only the beginning\". The government and its partners would \"need to be creative and responsive\". Some 拢3.7bn will be spent on implementing the programme by 2006. The report recommends gathering more details on the educational needs of areas, so courses can be set to meet local demand. Existing adult learners could use their \"enthusiasm, commitment and local knowledge\" to attract other people. The Department for Education and Skills could also use more \"personalised learning\" and work with voluntary groups, councils and employers.\n\nIt should also assess adult learners\' progress \"at frequent intervals\", the report adds. When the government announced it had reached its 2004 target earlier this month, Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was \"only the start of the journey\". An estimated 5.2 million adults have worse literacy than that expected of 11 year olds, while 14.9 million have numeracy skills below this level. This is thought to cost the UK economy hundreds of millions of pounds each year. The qualifications achieved by those taking part in the government\'s scheme range up to GCSE equivalents. Get On\'s participation target has been set at 2.25 million by 2010, with an interim figure of 1.5 million by 2007. Education minister Ivan Lewis said: \"We will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace.\" Shadow Education Secretary Tim Collins said: \"This is the third report in two days to highlight Labour\'s failure to ensure young people acquire the necessary levels of literacy and numeracy for their working life. \"Employers and business leaders have repeatedly voiced concern over the number of school-leavers without these basic skills, but all the government have offered is more talk.\" Liberal Democrat education spokesman Phil Willis added: \"Far too little has been done to enable adult learners to fit learning into their busy lives.\"\n'
'\'My memories of Marley...\'\n\nTo mark the 60th anniversary of the birth of reggae star Bob Marley, Rob Partridge - Marley\'s former head of press at Island Records - remembers the man behind the legend.\n\nPartridge worked with Marley from 1977 until the Jamaican musician\'s death in 1981.\n\n: \"I joined Island Records in 1977 and the first week I was there I worked on his show at the Rainbow Theatre. It was one of the last dates he did in London.\"\n\n: The album Exodus came out in 1977 and that provided five hits and confirmed his global superstar status. \"By 1979 he was the biggest touring attraction in the world. I remember going to see dates in Milan and Turin and they were enormous concerts.\"\n\n: Bob was one of the most mesmeric people I\'ve ever had the privilege to work with. \"He must have had an iron will to succeed. Bob was a very driven individual. You realised from the start there was a manifest destiny within him that he believed in. He didn\'t suffer fools gladly. At the risk of stating the obvious, he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest I\'ve ever seen. I saw him many times.\"\n\n: \"I recall in 1978 he came to the UK for Top of the Pops and a Daily Mirror journalist did a half-hour interview. It was interrupted to do a rehearsal. He came back into the dressing room to resume the interview but saw a World Cup match on TV.\n\n\"He sat down in front of the TV and after 10 minutes it was obvious he wasn\'t going to move. That was the end of it. The Mirror had a very truncated interview. \"The last time I saw him was in London in 1980. I arranged for him to play four days of football indoors in Fulham. \"Bob was a good player. We are talking about Jamaican-style football. He was an attacking midfield player. His team assembled wherever his gigs were. We played in Brazil against some World Cup-winning players.\"\n\n: It was always a struggle for him to connect with Black America. Reggae did not correspond with disco in the 70s. But Bob in the 1990s became one of the great icons in America and the Third World. \"In 1991, ten years after his death, he sold more records than at any time during his life. \"We saw Black America taking Bob into their hearts for the first time.\"\n\n: \"Bob, in worldwide terms, is the greatest music star there has ever been. If you went to Africa he would be recognised everywhere, in places John Lennon or Elvis wouldn\'t be. \"No disrespect to the other artists but a case can be made for him as the greatest, the best and the most influential artist in popular music.\"\n\n: Well 1981 was to be the year he toured Africa with Stevie Wonder. He had only performed in Zimbabwe and Guinea before. \"Of course the 1981 tour never happened, but the whole of Africa would have embraced him. We can\'t speculate but he was at the height of his powers and just 36 years old. I had no sense his career was going to go downhill.\"\n\n: \"Bob was endlessly optimistic about the way Africa would turn out. He realised that nothing was perfect but he had total belief in the power of mankind. \"I\'m sure if he were alive today he would believe Africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the Aids epidemic.\"\n\n: \"The final tune of his final album was Redemption Song - one of the most incredible classics of all time.\"\n'
'\'No more concessions\' on terror\n\nCharles Clarke says he has \"no desire\" to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book.\n\nMPs voted in favour of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill after Mr Clarke agreed to key changes - but Labour\'s majority was reduced to 14. The Bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. Lord Strathclyde, Tory leader in the Lords, said ministers should expect it to be \"substantially re-written\".\n\nThe Bill proposes \"control orders\", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. They would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against.\n\nOn Monday, MPs voted 272-219 in favour of the Bill after key concessions from Mr Clarke. The government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the Commons despite the support of 62 Labour rebels. Mr Clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the Lords to ensure the most controversial control order, amounting to house arrest, would be imposed by judges and not politicians. Lord Strathclyde warned ministers that they should \"prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the Bill\". \"They should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and I think they should drop the most objectionable proposals, which are for house arrest.\"\n\nBut Mr Clarke told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme he believed the changes he had made to the Bill to win over critics in the Commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the Lords. \"No Bill goes through Parliament without detailed consideration being made, but I believe that what I announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the House of Lords,\" he said.\n\n\"I have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the Bill.\" Mr Clarke\'s proposed amendment will be debated by the Lords on Tuesday without having been considered by MPs. The debate is unlikely to result in a vote. Speaking after the Commons debate, shadow home secretary David Davies said the bill had been \"clearly very badly drawn-up\" and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly. He said it would be possible to \"rescue\" the government and make the law \"tolerable\" by amending it in the Lords. \"The scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous,\" he told BBC News.\n\nMark Oaten, for the Liberal Democrats, said Monday night\'s vote showed the government had \"lost the confidence of all sides of the House\". He said: \"They need to rethink the bill, and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders, build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects. \"Unless there is a major movement, this bill is doomed to fail.\"\n\nBBC News political editor Andrew Marr said: \"I think that this is a bill in deep trouble. It\'s been unravelling in the House of Commons - it may unravel further.\" The government wants the new bill to pass into law by 14 March, when the current powers expire.\n'
'\'No re-draft\' for EU patent law\n\nA proposed European law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the European Commission (EC) despite requests by MEPs.\n\nThe law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. Some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions, while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms The EC says the Council of Ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last May but said it would review \"all aspects of the directive\". The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, \"computer implemented invention\".\n\nIn a letter, EC President Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso told the President of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, that the Commission \"did not intend to refer a new proposal to the Parliament and the Council (of ministers)\" as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in May 2004.\n\nIf the European Council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the European Parliament. But that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. Most EU legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the Council of Ministers before it becomes law. French Green MEP Alain Lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the Commission ignored the Parliament\'s request it would be an \"insult\" to the assembly. He said that the parliament would then reject the Council\'s version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted.\n\nThis means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service, for example. Critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in Europe. This, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US.\n'

'\'No UK apology\' for colonial past\n\nThe days of Britain having to apologise for its colonial past are over, Gordon Brown has said.\n\nThe chancellor, speaking during a week-long tour of Africa, said it was time to talk about enduring British values of liberty and tolerance. Mr Brown has signed a debt relief deal with Tanzania which could cost the UK 拢1 billion. South African president Thabo Mbeki has attacked British imperialists, saying they treated Africans like savages. Mr Brown said that missionairies had come to Africa because of their sense of duty. He added that the history of internationalism and enterprise had given Britain a greater global reach than any other country. BBC political correspondent Mark Mardell said Britishness had long been a theme of the chancellor\'s but \"never before has he been so outspoken in defending Britain\'s past history\".\n\nThe UK has pledged to pay 10\% of the developing world\'s foreign debt bill in an attempt to fight poverty. On top of the relief deal with Tanzania Mr Brown said the UK would make similar offers to 70 poorer nations around the world. Under the plan - which could cost the UK 拢1bn - countries must spend the cash saved on health, education and welfare. \"We make this offer unilaterally but we are now asking other countries to join us,\" the chancellor said. Mr Brown, on a week-long tour of Africa, spent two days in Tanzania before heading on Friday evening to Mozambique, a country where more than half of the 17-million population lives below the poverty line.\n\nThere he is expected to strike a similar debt relief pact. The chancellor said he hoped other G8 and European countries would follow suit. The UK has already cancelled its bilateral debts - money the UK alone is owed - with the world\'s poorest nations including Tanzania. Former international development secretary Clare Short questioned the effectiveness of debt relief as a means of tackling poverty.\n'
'\'No-one can define new hunt ban\'\n\nThe new law banning hunting with dogs is \"so poorly drafted\" no-one can define the offence, pro-hunt MPs say.\n\nThe accusation came after it emerged a Devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to \"chase away unwanted animals\" from his farm. Because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting. Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting - chasing away - and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules.\n\nNorth Devon landowner Giles Bradshaw was put in touch with the Middle Way Group, of which Mr Opik is a co-chairman, after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry, Defra. He had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the Hunting Act. Mr Bradshaw was initially told it was an offence - prompting him to complain. The Middle Way group also said Mr Bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free. In a later conversation Mr Bradshaw was told that according to Defra\'s lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was \"not in fact hunting as described in the Hunting Act 2004 therefore you would not be committing an offence\".\n\nMr Opik said: \"Hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the Hunting Act. \"Now Defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting - \'chasing away\' which isn\'t even covered by the Act. \"However, all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals. \"How is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting, exempt hunting, drag hunting, unintentional hunting, a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away?\" Tory MP Peter Luff, another co-chairman of Middle Way, said that the legislation was \"so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence\".\n\n\"It is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law. However, I seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating.\" Mike Hobday, of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \"There is no confusion, it is a matter of simple common sense. \"If Mr Bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence. \"If all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer, then nobody can define that as hunting.\"\n'
'\'Nuclear dumpsite\' plan attacked\n\nPlans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the UK have been branded \"deeply irresponsible\" by the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe government has confirmed intermediate level waste (ILW) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the UK. The cash raised will go towards the UK\'s nuclear clean-up programme. But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused ministers of turning Britain into a \"nuclear dumpsite\".\n\nUnder current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back. In future, only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin, normally Germany or Japan, under armed guard. Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK. At the moment, this waste is stored at Sellafield, in Cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a \"sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries\". And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.\n\nTrade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to 拢680m for Britain\'s nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency. But the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the Liberal Democrats. Mr Baker, the Lib Dem environment spokesman, said: \"I have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times. But now our worst fears have been confirmed. \"Once again Britain\'s environmental and health needs are being ignored in policies driven by the Treasury and DTI. \"This is a terrible attempt to offload some of the 拢48bn cost of cleaning up nuclear sites. \"The Energy Act was supposed to help Britain clean up, but in order to pay for it we are becoming a nuclear dumpsite. \"The nuclear industry is an economic, social and environmental millstone that hangs around Britain\'s neck.\"\n'
'\'Podcasters\' look to net money\n\nNasa is doing it, 14-year-old boys in bedrooms are doing it, couples are doing it, gadget lovers - male and female - are definitely doing it.\n\nIt is podcasting - DIY radio in the form of downloadable MP3 audio files. They can done by anyone who has a microphone, simple software, the net, and something to say. Some liken them to talking \"audioblogs\" because many complement text-based weblogs - diary-like sites where people share their thoughts. They are essentially amateur radio shows on the net, on demand, and the \"movement\" is at very early stages. \"It\'s about real people saying real things and communicating,\" says Adam Curry, former MTV VJ and the Pied Piper of podcasting. He was one of a community of people who created iPodder, a small computer program, known as an \"aggregator\".\n\nIt collects and automatically sends MP3 files to any digital music-playing device that can play WMP formats. Those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like, and subscribe - for free - to that show\'s \"feed\". When a new podcast is available, it is automatically sent to the device when connected to a computer. \"It is totally going to kill the business model of radio,\" thinks Curry. \"I just did a tour of Madison Avenue where all the big brands and advertising agencies of the world are,\" he says. \"And they are scared to death of the next generation - like my daughter who is 14 - who don\'t listen to radio. \"They are on MSN, they\'ve got their iPod, their MP3 player, they\'ve got their Xbox - they are not listening to radio. \"So how are they going to reach these audiences? \"It is the distribution that is changing and the barriers are being brought down so everyone can be part of it.\"\n\nIt is a fledgling movement, but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it. Ian Fogg, Jupiter Research analyst, thinks there could be potential for business, but it could take an interesting turn if big companies, like Apple and Microsoft, get involved. \"It is a nascent area but quite exciting. It is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over,\" he says.\n\n\"Podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about - a classic hybrid. It is another aspect of the \"time-shifting\" of content - the latest industry buzzword for being able to listen to what you want, when, and wherever you want. Audiences are in the 10s, 100s, and 1,000s rather than millions. More than 4,300 podcasts are currently listed. Curry\'s Daily Source Code - which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community - has 10s of thousands of listeners.\n\nBut Dave Winer is doubtful. He designed the format called RSS (Really Simple Syndication), which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like. Podcasts rely on his technology because it is the way they are distributed. He is also writer of the longest-running weblog on the net, Scripting News. He thinks its power lies in its democratising potential, not in its \"over-hyped\" business promise.\n\n\"We\'re the sources, the people doing stuff, and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what we\'re doing. \"No matter how you look at it, commercialising this medium isn\'t going to make very much money,\" he says. \"Podcasting is going to be a medium of niches, with \'audiences\' measured in the single digits, like e-mail or blogs. \"Maybe in a few years, maybe six or seven digits. But it will have to sustain interest beyond the hype balloon.\" Curry and associate Ron Bloom\'s new venture, called PodShow, is to help ordinary people produce, post, distribute and market their podcasts. Because of the way podcasts work, based on RSS, the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are ready-made targets. \"When you look at podcasting - wow this is a pretty interesting audience. The audience is pre-selected. They have decided to subscribe to your program,\" explains Curry. Advertising, in his eyes, can be tailored to podcasts, to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive. \"How I believe this will work, is to create a network that, in aggregation, will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters. \"I have 50, 60, 70,000 listeners. I could make a couple of bucks off that, but not much. If you are talking a million podcasters, and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves, then that is kind of interesting.\" Essentially, he says, if you are doing a bass fishing podcast, someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show. He is clear the ads will not be the traditional \"in-your-face\" type familiar to commercial radio now. \"We are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place.\"\n\nIt is happening already. Coffee-loving Curry has sold $4,000 worth of coffee machines through a referral link to Amazon from his site.\n\nOthers use in-show promotions, like The Dawn and Drew Show. One, Eric Rice, has won sponsorship from Warner Bros. He can now legally play the music of a band Warner Bros wants to push. Some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days. Others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative. One thing is for sure; they are not about to disappear in a hurry. The creative forces behind radio are elated, says Curry. For now, he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community. \"I should be knighted for this,\" he adds, with a wry chuckle, \"People are going to be so happy to sit at home, make their podcast, and make a little money.\"\n'
'\'Poll Idols\' face first hurdles\n\nVote For Me - ITV1\'s Pop Idol style talent contest for would-be politicians - finally hits our screens this week.\n\nOver the next four days, hundreds of potential candidates will be whittled down by a panel of experts and public vote. The winner will then be encouraged to stand as an independent at the next general election, which is expected in the spring. But opinion is divided on whether any of the potential candidates unearthed so far have got what it takes to make it in politics. \"Any of them would make competent MPs,\" former independent MP Martin Bell insisted on BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme.\n\nMr Bell, who will be offering his advice to the contestants on Wednesday, argues that Westminster has its share of \"odd balls\" and the show will engage ordinary voters. \"If it gets more people voting and more people interested in politics there is no harm in that,\" he said. But Sir Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher\'s former press secretary, took a less charitable view, accusing the programme of \"corrupting politics\".\n\nHe said the producers would not achieve their aim of re-engaging voters \"with that bunch of nutters\". To give Sir Bernard his dues, Monday evening\'s opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and self-publicists. Among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star, who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels. Among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on Bruce Forsyth\'s birthday and Bill Oddie for prime minister. The show follows the time-honoured Pop Idol format, with queues of nervous hopefuls and a panel of three experts judging their performance.\n\nThe contestants were given 60 seconds to present their manifestos. Then the final 25 were tested on their lobbying ability. They were then cross-examined by the panel, which was chaired by ex-ITN political editor John Sergeant, with television host Lorraine Kelly taking the Nicki Chapman role. But the real star of the show is Kelvin MacKenzie, in the Simon Cowell, Mr Nasty seat.\n\nThe former Sun editor dispensed a stream of well-crafted insults and one-liners. His advice for one young contestant was to \"get a haircut and a brain transplant\". Wheelchair user Kevin Donnellon was asked: \"Why on earth do you want our elected representatives to be disabled?\" \"Don\'t you care about the Inuit?\", implored guitar-toting environmental campaigner Barry Lim. \"I don\'t care about them. I care about myself and when the sun\'s shining I think - fantastic,\" replied Mr MacKenzie.\n\nMr Lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes. \"When the prime minister turns to the chancellor and says how much have we got in the coffers Mr Brown, he says well, prime minister, bad news, all the houses in Britain have been painted but actually nobody has paid any tax,\" observed Mr MacKenzie. \"That was an total disaster. I just couldn\'t seem to think of things to say,\" a crestfallen Mr Lim confided in the show\'s presenter, Jonathan Maitland. Irfan Hanif, a 25-year-old doctor from Bolton, made a good impression, even if he was a little thrown by Mr MacKenzie\'s suggestion that instead of being treated by the NHS, young drunks should \"given a good beating\" and left to die. Dominic Carman - son of late libel lawyer George Carman - was voted through to the final 25, on a platform of cutting defence spending to boost education. Opinion was more divided over Rodney Hylton-Potts, a 59-year-old convicted fraudster. Mr MacKenzie thought the smooth-talking former solicitor - with a hardline on crime and immigration - deserved a chance to progress. \"He could join the rest of the crooks in the Houses of Parliament.\" But Ms Kelly said she \"would not trust him as far as she could throw him\". The series continues throughout the week, with the public given the chance to evict one prospective MP every night. ITV will not fund the election campaign for the eventual winner, but the publicity could give the winner a flying start over other candidates.\n'
'\'Post-Christmas lull\' in lending\n\nUK mortgage lending showed a \"post-Christmas lull\" in January, indicating a slowing housing market, lenders have said.\n\nBoth the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) and Building Society Association (BSA) said lending was down sharply. The CML said gross mortgage lending stood at 拢17.9bn, compared with 拢21.8bn in January last year. The BSA said mortgage approvals - loans approved but not yet made - were 拢2bn, down from 拢2.6bn in January 2004.\n\nAt the same time, the British Bankers\' Association (BBA) said lending was \"weaker\". Overall, the BBA said mortgage lending rose by 拢4bn in January, a far smaller increase than the 拢5.1bn seen in December. This was a return to the \"weaker pattern\" of lending seen in the last months of 2004, the BBA added. However, it is the year-on-year lending comparisons which are the most striking. The CML said lending for house purchases and gross mortgage lending were 29\% and 18\% lower year-on-year respectively. \"These figures show beyond doubt the recent slowdown in the housing market,\" Peter Williams, CML deputy director, said.\n'
'\'Standoff\' on Deutsche\'s LSE bid\n\nDeutsche Boerse investors unhappy with its London Stock Exchange bid will have no chance to throw out the exchange\'s management until May, Reuters says.\n\nThe Sunday Times reported that hedge funds TCI and Atticus were planning to demand the removal of the group\'s chairman and chief executive. But Deutsche Boerse told news agency Reuters such a move would have to wait until May\'s annual general meeting. Investors want Deutsche to return cash to shareholders rather than bid. \"We are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management. We are not scared to take this to its conclusion this time,\" Atticus\' David Slager told the Sunday Times. However, Deutsche Boerse told Reuters: \"TCI\'s request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on May 25.\"\n\nThe Sunday Times reported that TCI had been drawing up a list of heavyweight executives to replace Deutsche\'s chairman Rolf Breuer and chief executive Werner Seifert. The group owns more than 5\% of Deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the German exchange\'s management. Under German law Deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid. TCI and Atticus have opposed the LSE bid for some time saying it would destroy shareholder value, and would be better spent on a share buyback. Deutsche is in competition with pan-European bourse Euronext to take over the London exchange. Many commentators have suggested a bidding war between the two could break out. However, any such move would have to wait until March when the Office of Fair Trading completes an investigation into the competition aspects of the pair\'s takeover proposals.\n'
'\'Strong dollar\' call halts slide\n\nThe US dollar\'s slide against the euro and yen has halted after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was \"in America\'s interest\".\n\nBut analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the US economy were still significant. They also pointed out that positive comments apart, President George W Bush\'s administration had done little to stop the dollar\'s slide. A weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. The dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100GMT, still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 November. Against the Japanese yen, it was trading at 105.28 yen, after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.\n\nPolicy makers in Europe have called the dollar\'s slide \"brutal\" and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. However, it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro\'s rise at a monthly meeting of Eurozone ministers late on Monday. Higher growth in Europe is regarded by US officials as a way the huge US current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. Mr Snow who is currently in Dublin at the start of a four-nation EU visit, has applauded Ireland\'s introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth. \"The eurozone is growing below its potential. When a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners,\" he said. Mr Snow\'s comments may have helped shore up the dollar on Monday, but he was careful to qualify his statement.\n\n\"Our basic policy, of course, is to let open, competitive markets set the values,\" he explained. \"Markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals.\" US officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the US is not the main global growth engine. Economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the US economy are looking far from rosy. Domestic consumer demand is cooling, and heavy spending by President Bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (拢230bn). The current account deficit, meanwhile, hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. For many analysts, a weaker dollar is here to stay. \"No end is in sight,\" said Carsten Fritsch, a strategist at Commerzbank . \"It is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30.\" Some analysts maintain the US is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in Europe, thus boosting its economy.\n'
'\'Super union\' merger plan touted\n\nTwo of Britain\'s big trade unions could merge to form a \"super union\" of two million members.\n\nThe move by Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) would be a seen as a bid to carry more weight with ministers and employers. Amicus has 1.2 million members and the TGWU has 800,000. Any merger would have to be approved by the unions\' executives and their membership. It is understood meetings will be held on Wednesday about the proposal. Along with the GMB and Unison, the TGWU and Amicus worked closely together in the last year to hammer out a 56-point deal with Labour\'s leadership over equality at work, holidays and pensions - the Warwick Agreement. Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the merger rumours, but one insider pointed out to the BBC News website that \"nobody is denying suggestions a merger could be on the agenda\" when the two unions\' executives hold their meetings on Wednesday. Amicus\'s executive was due to meet in any case although the TGWU is holding specially scheduled talks.\n'

'\'UK will stand firm on EU rebate\'\n\nBritain\'s 拢3bn EU rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week\'s European Council summit, Jack Straw said.\n\nThe foreign secretary told MPs the rebate, secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984, was \"entirely justified\". New European commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has suggested the cash could be shared out among net contributors to the EU budget. Mr Straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged 25 nation EU still had to \"see the light\" on the rebate.\n\nBut the foreign secretary told the Commons foreign affairs committee: \"Our position is very clear: it is entirely justified and it is not for negotiation.\" He added that he did not think there would be a political price to pay for the UK\'s stance - Britain contributed more and received less than other EU states. The two-day European Council summit in Brussels begins on 16 December and is widely expected to mark the beginning of a lengthy negotiating period over the EU\'s budget for 2007-13. The wrangling could stretch into 2005, even 2006.\n\nThe UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1\% of member states\' combined national incomes - the Commission wants it to be 1.26\%. Mr Straw said the EU commission\'s proposal would mean a 35\% hike in the budget. \"I don\'t know of any national government thinking of increasing its budget by that amount,\" he added. The foreign secretary said he hoped the talks next week could produce a date in 2005 for the beginning of negotiations with Turkey about possible EU membership although that there would be no prospect of a date for joining for some time.\n'
'\'Ultimate game\' award for Doom 3\n\nSci-fi shooter Doom 3 has blasted away the competition at a major games ceremony, the Golden Joystick awards.\n\nIt was the only title to win twice, winning Ultimate Game of the year and best PC game at the awards, presented by Little Britain star Matt Lucas. The much-anticipated sci-fi horror Doom 3 shot straight to the top of the UK games charts on its release in August. Other winners included Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas which took the Most Wanted for Christmas prize. Only released last week, it was closely followed by Halo 2 and Half-Life 2, which are expected to be big hits when they are unleashed later this month.\n\nBut they missed out on the prize for the Most Wanted game of 2005, which went to the Nintendo title, The Legend of Zelda. The original Doom, released in 1994, heralded a new era in computer games and introduced 3D graphics. It helped to establish the concept of the first-person shooter. Doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around $15m (拢8.3m). The top honour for the best online game of the year went to Battlefield Vietnam. The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay was handed the Unsung Hero Game of 2004. Its release was somewhat eclipsed by Doom 3, which was released on the same week. It was, however, very well received by gamers and was praised for its storyline which differed from the film released around the same time. Electronic Arts was named top publisher of the year, taking the crown from Nintendo which won in 2003. The annual awards are voted for by more than 200,000 readers of computer and video games magazines. Games awards like this have grown in importance. Over the last six years, the UK market for games grew by 100\% and was worth a record 拢1,152m in 2003, according to a recent report by analysts Screen Digest.\n'

'A decade of good website design\n\nThe web looks very different today than it did 10 years ago.\n\nBack in 1994, Yahoo had only just launched, most websites were text-based and Amazon, Google and eBay had yet to appear. But, says usability guru Dr Jakob Nielsen, some things have stayed constant in that decade, namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use. Dr Nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today. \"Roughly 80\% of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today,\" he said. \"Some have gone away because users have changed and 10\% have changed because technology has changed.\"\n\nSome design crimes, such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit, and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared, said Dr Nielsen.\n\n\"But there\'s great stability on usability concerns,\" he told the BBC News website. Dr Nielsen said the basic principles of usability, centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site\'s total design, were as important as ever. \"It\'s necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such,\" he said. They are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would. \"A lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off,\" he said. \"But there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband.\"\n\nDr Nielsen said the success of sites such as Google, Amazon, eBay and Yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important. \"Those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful,\" said Dr Nielsen, adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net.\n\n\"All are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet,\" he said. \"They are making simple but powerful tools available to the user. \"None of them have a fancy or glamorous look,\" he added, declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied. In the future, Dr Nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online. \"They are becoming like the operating system to the internet,\" he said. But, he said, the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better. Currently, he said, search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries. Often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not. Tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results. Research by Dr Nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines. The latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that, on average, they use 2.2 terms. In 1994 only 1.3 words were used. \"I think it\'s amazing that we have seen a doubling in a 10-year period of those search terms,\" said Dr Nielsen.\n\nYou can hear more from Jakob Nielsen and web design on the BBC World Service programme, Go Digital\n'
'A November to remember\n\nLast Saturday, one newspaper proclaimed that England were still the number one side in the world.\n\nThat statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at Twickenham. But it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of Test rugby at the highest level, at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series. The final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion, with Australia\'s triumph in London followed by France\'s capitulation to New Zealand. \"Clearly, there is no number one side in the world at the moment,\" declared Wallabies coach Eddie Jones on arrival back in Sydney. \"There are four, five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1\%.\"\n\nWhile that bodes well for rugby as a whole, it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open Six Nations Championship for a decade. While the Wallabies, All Blacks and Springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to Super 12 matters in the new year, Europe\'s finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray. And for the first time in more than a decade, it will not simply be a straightforward choice between England and France for the Six Nations title.\n\nThat owes much to Ireland\'s continued progress and the belief that Wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays.\n\n, who secured a first Triple Crown in 19 years last season, could go one better and win their first Five/Six Nations title since 1985. They start with away games against Italy and Scotland, before England and France come to Lansdowne Road.\n\nTheir momentous victory over the Springboks can only bolster Ireland\'s self-belief, while Ronan O\'Gara\'s late drop goal to deliver victory over Argentina was further proof that Eddie O\'Sullivan\'s side can now close out tight games. Not that England or France, who have won nine of the last 10 Six Nations titles between them, will lay down quietly.\n\ndismantling of the Springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as Martin Johnson and Lawrence Dallaglio, they still have the personnel to prosper.\n\nThe narrow defeat to Australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden, but the fresh shoots of post-World Cup recovery have been sown by new head coach Andy Robinson. A fresh desire to regain former heights is evident, and if England emerge triumphant from an opening Six Nations engagement in Cardiff, a fourth title in six years is within reach.\n\nare in familiar revival territory, but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style.\n\nWhile South Africa\'s over-confidence in Cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected, Wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the All Blacks in one of the best Tests in recent memory. If Mike Ruddock can coax a reliable set-piece platform from his pack, there is no reason why victories should not ensue come February. The last fortnight has left\n\nin a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over Australia. A stunning defeat to Argentina, their first loss since the World Cup, could have been attributed to trademark French inconsistency.\n\nBut the manner of New Zealand\'s 45-6 demolition job in Paris has coach Bernard Laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard. Fortunately for the French, the opening match of the Six Nations sees them entertaining\n\nin Paris. After two reasonable performances against Australia, the Scots\' humbling by the Springboks forced coach Matt Williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent. While individuals such as Chris Cusiter and Ali Hogg enhanced their reputations, a lack of top-class players will continue to undermine their best efforts.\n\n, who start with home games against Ireland and Wales before travelling to Scotland, are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the Championship. As autumn gives way to winter and the Heineken Cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime, the joy of Six will keep the home fires burning until February.\n'
'A question of trust and technology\n\nA major government department is without e-mail for a week, and technology analyst Bill Thompson wants to know what happened.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I wrote about how my girlfriend had suffered when her cable modem blew up and she was offline for several days. It seems that thousands of civil servants at the UK\'s Department of Work and Pensions went through the same thing last week. It has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way, depriving staff of e-mail and access to the application software they use to calculate people\'s benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances. Senior consultants from EDS, the computer firm which manage the system, and Microsoft, which supplied the software, were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all, while staff resorted to phone, fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done. Fortunately the back-office systems which actually pay people their money were still working, so only new claims and updates were affected done properly. This is bad enough for those affected, but it does mean that the impact is not devastating for millions of pensioners. I am sure regular readers will be expecting one of my usual diatribes against poor software, badly specified systems and inadequate disaster recovery plans.\n\nAlthough the full story has not yet been told, it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from Windows 2000 to Windows XP went wrong, and XP code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network.\n\nThis is certainly unfortunate, but I have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved. Today\'s computer networks are large, complex and occasionally fragile. The interconnectedness that we all value also gives us a degree of instability and unpredictability that we cannot design out of the systems. It is the network equivalent of Godel\'s Theorem - any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically. So I will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck. What is really disturbing, and cannot be excused, is the fact that it took four days for news of this systems failure to leak out into the technical press.\n\nIt is, without a doubt, a major story and was the second or third lead item on BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme throughout Friday morning.\n\nSo why did not the prime minister\'s official spokesman mention it at any lobby briefings before Friday? Why was not the pensions minister in Parliament to make an emergency statement on Tuesday, when it was clear that there was a serious problem? If there had been an outbreak of Legionnaire\'s disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told, but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatment. While EDS and Microsoft will no doubt be looking for technical lessons to learn from their week of pain, we can learn some political lessons too. And the most important is that in this digital world, technology failures are matters of public interest, not something that can be ignored in the hope that nobody will notice, care or understand. That means we need a full report on what went wrong and what was done to fix it. It would be unacceptable for any of the parties involved to hide behind commercial confidentiality or even parliamentary privilege. A major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently. Anything less is a betrayal of public trust.\n\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.\n'
'A year to remember for Irish\n\nThere used to be one subliminal moment during a year in Irish rugby that stood out more than most.\n\nWell, at least there used to one. Now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction, and sorrow. It has been quite a year for the Irish, and not just with Eddie O\'Sullivan\'s Triple Crown winning international outfit either. Right down through the ranks Irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game. But most of the kudos will go to O\'Sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first Triple Crown for 29 years, but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100\% record. For the second year in succession they also finished in the runners-up spot in the RBS Six Nations. But in the three games in November which included a victory over Tri-Nations champions and Grand Slam chasing South Africa, Ireland finsihed the year on a high. The 18-12 victory at Lansdowne Road was only their second victory over the Boks after the initial success back in 1965. That success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in Blomefontein and Cape Town in the summer. Those two reverses and the 35-17 flop against France, were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months. But the big one, of course, was the 19-13 defeat of World Cup champions England on their precious Twickenham turf. The winning try was conceived in O\'Sullivan\'s mind, perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by Girvan Dempsey. For me, the try of the Championship. O\'Sullivan\'s career is now in vertical take-off mode. It is no wonder that Sir Clive Woodward has elevated the Galway-based coach to head the Lions Test side. Not only that, but a fair majority of the present Ireland side will be wearing red next June in New Zealand.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Ireland\'s representation will be the biggest ever, albeit in a proposed 44-man squad. In Brian O\'Driscoll and Paul O\'Connell, Ireland have now the two front-runners for the captaincy. Gordon D\'Arcy, whose career began as a teenager back in 1999, finally arrived when he was named the Six Nations Player of the Tournament. But it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to Ireland, the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well. The under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the World Cup final in Scotland only to be beaten by a powerful All Black side in the decider. The young Irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners-up to England in the Six Nations under-21 tournament. On the provincial front, Leinster, for second year in succession, blew it when the Heineken Cup looked a good wager. While Ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession, it was Munster again flying the flag for the Irish. Looking to reach their third final, they went down 37-32 to eventual winners Wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at Lansdowne Road. How Wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel, and then go onto to defeat Toulouse in the final was anybody\'s guess. Ulster, meanwhile, just lost out to adding the inaugural Celtic Cup in winning the Celtic League when they were pipped at the post by the Scarlets in the final game.\n\nUlster, however, took time to start the new season under new coach Mark McCall. The once famous Ravenhill fortress was breached four times as Ulster only manged five wins from their first 12 outings in the Celtic League. Leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into 2005, but whether they can take that final step under Declan Kidney is another thing. On the down side, Irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies. Teenage star John McCall died while playing for the Ireland against New Zealand in the under-19 World Cup game in Durban. That happened only 10 days after he led Royal Armagh to their first Ulster Schools\' Cup success since 1977. The death of former Ireland coach and Lions flanker Mike Doyle in a car crash in Northern Ireland shocked the rugby fraternity A larger than life character, Doyle had coached Ireland to the Triple Crown in 1985, the last time that goal had been achieved before this season. Ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well-known Londonderry YM player Jim Huey, Coleraine\'s Jonathan Hutchinson, and Belfast Harlequins lock Johnny Poole. They all passed away long before the full-time whistle.\n'
'A-listers flock to Gervais sitcom\n\nHollywood actors Samuel L Jackson and Ben Stiller have signed up for Ricky Gervais\' new sitcom, the comedian has told BBC News.\n\nHe said they had both seen the scripts and had agreed to appear in an episode each of the sitcom Extras. They join British stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet who have been booked for guest roles. The comic and actor said he had drawn up an A-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it. \"We wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct,\" Gervais told BBC News.\n\n\"It\'s not about the zeitgeist. We wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of Big Brother to take part.\" Gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line. But he has met with Stiller and Jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.\n\n\"I didn\'t want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who haven\'t even been asked. \"I have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as I\'m going to be in a remake of 10 taking Dudley Moore\'s part. I haven\'t been approached and I wouldn\'t take it anyway.\"\n\nHe said Stiller and Jackson would be playing \"twisted\" versions of themselves in Extras and that the jokes about them \"would sail pretty close to the bone\". Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series, in which Gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. Meanwhile, Gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book Flanimals which is released in the US in March, around the same time as NBC begin showing the US version of The Office. The film rights to Flanimals have already been snapped up but Gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly. \"A film will happen over the next three years but I don\'t want it to be a $50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldn\'t be another Spider-Man or Batman. I would like to do something small on TV with it first.\"\n'
'Aaliyah claim dismissed by court\n\nLate R&B star Aaliyah\'s record company has failed in an attempt to sue the video producer who booked the ill-fated flight on which she died in 2001.\n\nA New York appeals court has told Blackground Records that only the singer\'s parents had the right to launch a claim for wrongful death. The 22-year-old singer\'s family came to an undisclosed settlement over a negligence claim in 2003. Aaliyah had completed a music video when the plane crashed in the Bahamas. She and eight others were killed on the plane, which crashed as if left for Florida. Blackground Records\' lawyer Frank Penski said he had yet to examine the decision and did not know whether they would pursue the case.\n\nAn investigation into the crash revealed the twin-engined Cessna was overloaded by 700 pounds (320kg). A post-mortem carried out on the remains of the pilot showed there was cocaine and alcohol in his body. Aaliyah was a rising star in music and film before she was killed. She was honoured with a string of posthumous awards and her single More Than A Woman went to number one in the UK.\n'
'Abba queen enters music rich list\n\nThe woman behind the Abba musical Mamma Mia! has joined a list of British-based music millionaires.\n\nProducer Judy Craymer is the highest new entry in the Sunday Times\' music rich list, with a 拢67m fortune. Ms Craymer remortgaged her home to finance her idea of a musical based around Abba\'s hits, which has since become a global triumph. Teenage soul singer Joss Stone is a new entry on a list of Britain\'s young music millionaires with 拢5m.\n\nMs Craymer, who developed Mamma Mia! with playwright Catherine Johnson and members of Abba, is at number 31 on the music rich list. But taking the top spot for a second year is former record label boss Clive Calder, whose wealth has risen to 拢1.3bn. Mr Calder is the man behind acts including Britney Spears. He made his fortune by selling his independent label Zomba to record giant BMG. Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney is second on the list with 拢800m - up 拢40m on last year. Andrew Lloyd-Webber\'s wealth rose an estimated 拢300m on last year, to 拢700m, while theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh\'s fortune rose from 拢340m to 拢400m.\n\nHis recent hits have included the West End show Mary Poppins. But Pop Idol mogul Simon Fuller has seen his wealth plummet from 拢220m last year to 拢75m after selling his entertainment company 19 for less than expected, according to the Sunday Times. Joss Stone, the 17-year-old soul singer from Devon, was a new entry in the young music millionaires list. The list also features Charlotte Church, Coldplay, Daniel Bedingfield, Will Young and David and Victoria Beckham. At number one is Dhani Harrison, son of the late Beatle George Harrison, who has inherited 拢140m. The Beckhams - who qualify thanks to Victoria\'s former singing career - are in second place with 拢75 million between them - up 拢10m on last year.\n'
'Abba reunite for musical premiere\n\nThe original stars of Swedish pop quartet Abba have reunited for the home premiere of hit musical Mamma Mia! which is based on the band\'s songs.\n\nIt is the first time in almost 20 years that the four, Bjorn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, have met publicly. Faltskog has been a virtual recluse since the band split up in 1982. The musical, which has become a global phenomenon, will be performed in Swedish for the first time. Fans camped outside Stockholm\'s Cirkus theatre in the snow for a glimpse of the stars. The premiere marks Abba\'s first public reunion since the legendary band\'s acrimonious break-up in the early 1980s. It was thought that Faltskog would appear in London for the musical\'s fifth anniversary celebrations in April 2004 but she stayed away due to her fear of flying.\n\nOriginal Abba member Bjorn Ulvaeus set about translating the musical into the band\'s mother tongue for the celebrated homecoming, alongside Swedish artist Niklas Stromstedt. Almost all of Abba\'s original songs, which have sold more than 350 million records worldwide, were written and recorded in English. The musical, set on a small Greek island, tells of the story of a young woman and her fiercely independent single mother. The show will include such classics as Super Trouper, SOS and Dancing Queen. There are currently 14 productions being staged worldwide, including New York and London, with road shows in Toronto, South Korea and Madrid. More than 20 million people around the world have seen the show.\n'
'Abbas \'will not tolerate\' attacks\n\nPalestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has said he will not tolerate attacks such as last Friday\'s suicide bombing in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.\n\nIn an interview ahead of a meeting in London to discuss Palestinian reforms, Mr Abbas said such attacks were against Palestinian interests. The Palestinian Authority (PA) was exerting \"a 100\% effort\" to end the violence, Mr Abbas added. The attack, which killed five, was the first of its kind since he took office. Mr Abbas confirmed Israel shared information with the PA in the hunt for the organisers of the attack. The Israeli government refuses to accept Syria\'s denials that it was implicated in the nightclub bombing. Israeli officials gave an intelligence briefing to foreign ambassadors on Monday, explaining Syria\'s alleged involvement. British foreign minister Jack Straw said there had been a \"continuing stream\" of information suggesting Palestinian militant groups were operating from within Syria.\n\nIn an email interview in the British newspaper the Independent, Mr Abbas said: \"We believe peace is possible now and we are ready to negotiate with Israel to reach a true and lasting peace based on justice and international legitimacy.\" He added: \"We have an opportunity and it would be irresponsible if we, the Israelis, or the world allow it to slip away.\" Tuesday\'s meeting on Palestinian reform is being hosted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Also due to attend are US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, World Bank officials and foreign ministers from 23 European and Arab countries. The conference was a \"vital step\" in renewing the peace process, Mr Straw said. \"It\'s a high-level attendance, which reflects the sense of momentum and opportunity created by recent events,\" he added. A spokesman for Mr Blair said the Prime Minister expected the conference to discuss \"a comprehensive, co-ordinated and, above all, practical work plan for both the Palestinian Authority and the international community\". Israel will not attend, but is said to be closely watching the outcome.\n'
